# Application of GA on scheduling an actual Exam Schedule for IIITM Gwalior

## Group Project made by: <ul><li>Deep Jawale</li><li>Darshan Arkhade</li><li>Manav Jethva</li></ul>

### 1st Iteration 
 We went over the idea of how to actually implement a genetic algorithm for creating a schedule and found that rather than makin a binary decision variable we can use a Schedule class which would contain a fitness value and a dictionary for storing the classrooms used that day.
For developing the skeleton for the project we need to implement the following things:
- [ ] Code the basic structure of the decision variable/chromosome
- [ ] Write code for loading the data
- [ ] Get the data in the format used to get it inputted from real life
- [ ] Write code for function for generating random population
- [ ]
